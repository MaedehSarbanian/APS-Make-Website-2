          <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
          <p>
            Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author
            Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective"
            in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with
            observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that
            borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases
            for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard. The
            character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887's A Study
            in Scarlet. His popularity became widespread with the first series
            of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A Scandal
            in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927,
            eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but
            one[a] are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about
            1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend
            and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes
            during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the
            address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories
            begin. Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is
            arguably the best known. By the 1990s, there were already over
            25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and
            publications featuring the detective, and Guinness World Records
            lists him as the most portrayed human literary character in film and
            television history. Holmes' popularity and fame are such that many
            have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real
            individual; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on
            this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the
            modern practice of fandom. The character and stories have had a
            profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture
            as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by
            authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio
            plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one
            hundred years.
